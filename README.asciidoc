=========================================

v1.0, September 26, 2010

Introduction
------------
This is a custom build of OpenFOAM 1.7.x (http://www.openfoam.org, OpenCFD Ltd)
created by Michael Wild <wild@ifd.mavt.ethz.ch>. Concerning licensing issues,
refer to the COPYING file included in this package.

[CAUTION]
AS THIS IS A CUSTOM BUILD (INCLUDING UNOFFICIAL PATCHES), THIS SOFTWARE IS
COMPLETELY UNSUPPORTED (NEITHER BY OPENCFD LTD NOR BY THE AUTHOR OF THIS
PACKAGE) AND COMES WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.

It has been configured to use the libraries and compiler included in Mac OS X
10.5 and its corresponding developer tools (Xcode 3.1). It uses OpenMPI as the
parallelization library.

The official source has been patched to include the fixes provided by B.
Gschaider
(http://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/openfoam-installation/77570-patches-openfoam-1-7-macos-x.html)
and applied additional fixes which are tracked in the
http://www.github.com/themiwi/OpenFOAM-1.7.x-OSX[git repository].

[CAUTION]
THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE AND PROBABLY NOT FIT FOR PRODUCTION USE. IT IS
ENTIRELY UNSUPPORTED AND YOU USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.

[CAUTION]
To save disk space, this package is distributed without the third-party sources
and intermediate files from the build process (e.g. object files) have been
removed as well. This is why you shouldn't try to issue an +./Allwmake+ in any of
the OpenFOAM-1.7.x directories. Furthermore the image is fixed-size and
read-only. If you want to compile your own codes, do so in your
'~/OpenFOAM/<username>-1.7.x directory'.

System Requirements
-------------------
- Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) or 10.6 (Snow Leopard)
- XCode 3.1 (provided on the Mac OS X installer DVD) or available from
http://developer.apple.com if you plan on compiling your own code.

Setup Instructions
------------------
- Download the appropriate disk image file ('\*.dmg') from below list to some
  convenient place of your choice ('~/OpenFOAM/images' is recommended):
+
--
  * Intel Macs: http://www.github.com/downloads/themiwi/OpenFOAM-1.7.x-OSX/OpenFOAM-1.7.x-0-MacOSX-10.5-darwinIntel64DPOpt.dmg
  * PowerPC Macs: http://www.github.com/downloads/themiwi/OpenFOAM-1.7.x-OSX/OpenFOAM-1.7.x-0-MacOSX-10.5-darwinPpcDPOpt.dmg
--
+
To the same directory download the file
http://github.com/themiwi/OpenFOAM-1.7.x-OSX/raw/master/setup_foam.sh['setup_foam.sh'].
*IMPORTANT*: Make sure that the browser you use does not add a +.txt+ extension
to the 'setup_foam.sh' file! Also, the 'Finder' usually lies to you about
filename extensions, so please enable the setting
'Finder->Preferences->Advanced->Show all filename extensions'.

- Adjust the file 'setup_foam.sh' to match your setup according to the
instructions in it. If you downloaded everything to '~/OpenFOAM/images', no
changes need be made.

- Type the following into 'Terminal.app':
+
------------------
test -f ~/.bash_profile && cp ~/.bash_profile ~/.bash_profile.bak_setup_foam_$(date '+%Y%m%d%H%M%S')
echo ". ~/OpenFOAM/images/setup_foam.sh" >> ~/.bash_profile
------------------
+
Make sure to replace '~/OpenFOAM/images/setup_foam.sh' with the actual path to the
'setup_foam.sh' file.

- *Restart 'Terminal.app'*

- Now, everytime you want to use OpenFOAM (i.e. when you started
  'Terminal.app', opened a new window or tab), type
+
------------------
setup_foam
------------------
+
which will create a user disk-image (if it doesn't exist already), mount all
the disk images and set up the environment for OpenFOAM.

- That's it, you should be all set and ready to go!
